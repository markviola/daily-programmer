#[Easy] Challenge #1

Create a program that will ask the users name, age, and reddit username. Have it tell them the information back, in the format:

```
Your name is (blank), you are (blank) years old, and your username is (blank)
```

For extra credit, have the program log this information in a file to be accessed later.
